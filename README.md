# ClemRemote v1.1
Remote for [Clementine Music Player](https://www.clementine-player.org/) ([github](https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine)) developed in C++/QT5/QML to be available on any OS. <br/>
It is published under **licence GPL v3** <br/>
You can fully control the music on your Clementine server: create playlists, browse the file system or the library, launch your saved internet radios...<br/>
It's designed like a player, so from any Menu you're seeing the current played track and can pause, change the position, go to the next one... and also change the level of the volume.<br/>
It's also possible to download the songs, albums or playlist<br/>
<br/>
I've built the v1.0 for [Linux](https://github.com/mbruel/ClementineRemote/releases/download/v1.0/ClemRemote_v1.0-x86_64.AppImage), [MacOS](https://github.com/mbruel/ClementineRemote/releases/download/v1.0/ClemRemote_v1.0.dmg) and [Win64](https://github.com/mbruel/ClementineRemote/releases/download/v1.0/ClemRemote_v1.0_x64_setup.exe) (there is also a [portable version for win64](https://github.com/mbruel/ClementineRemote/releases/download/v1.0/ClemRemote_v1.0_win64_portable.zip)).<br/>
<img align="left" width="80" height="80" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbruel/ClementineRemote/main/src/data/android_qr.png" alt="Clementine Remote for Android">

## Clementine version

## Thanks
Thanks to Clementine team to have made this great Music Player and allowing the remote control functionality for their [Android Remote](https://github.com/clementine-player/Android-Remote). The functionality is basic, not a real protocol, but that more than enough on a LAN ;)
